## Key Metrics
- Churn Rate: Percentage of customers who canceled their subscription
- Retention Rate: Percentage of customers who remained subscribed
- Average Tenure: Average number of months customers stayed before churn

### Churn by Subscription Plan
- Premium plan shows a higher churn rate compared to Basic, despite higher pricing.
- Users on the Basic plan tend to have shorter average tenure.
- This suggests pricing alone does not drive retention; early user engagement may be more critical.
